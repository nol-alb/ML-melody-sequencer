# ML-melody-sequencer

A simple melody step sequencer using Tone.js and NexusUI infused with magenta musicVAE trained models.

The basic functionality of this application is to allow a user to create a melody from the
notes in the chord c#m7, using the step sequencer over a predefined drum loop.

Onto this I have then incorporated two machine learning models to further enhance the capabilites of this application.
Once the user inputs their desired timing for a melody, the application will then proceed to create its own variations over an 8 measure loop.
Furthermore a Groove Drums button is added, which when pressed will generate variations of the existing drum loop, to humanize and create a sense of randomness.

This was my first time working with java script and html to create an interactive web application.
