# ML-melody-sequencer

A simple melody step sequencer using Tone.js and NexusUI infused with magenta musicVAE trained models.


The basic functionality of the application is to allow the user to create a melody using the
notes of the chord c#m7 using the step sequencer over a predefined drum loop.

To this I have then incorporated two machine learning models to further enhance the capabilites of the application.
Once the user inputs their desired timing for a melody, the application will then proceed to create its own variations over an 8 measure loop.
Furthermore a Groove Drums button is added, which will further generate variations of the existing drum loop, to humanize and create a sense of randomness.

This was my first time working with java script and html to create an interactive web application.

Here is a link to try it out!!
