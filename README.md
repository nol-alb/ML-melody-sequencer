# ML-melody-sequencer

A simple melody step sequencer using Tone.js and NexusUI infused with magenta musicVAE trained models.


The basic functionality of the application is to allow the user to create melody using the
notes of the chord c#m7 on a step sequencer over a predefined drum loop.

To this basic funcrtionality i have then incorporate two machine learning models to further enhance the capabilites of the application.
Once the user inputs their desired timing and melody, the application will then proceed to create its own variation over an 8m loop of your
pattern.
Furthermore a Groove Drums button is added which will again generate variations of the existing drum loop, to humanize and generate randomness.

This was my first time working with java script and html to create an interactive web application.

Here is a link to try it out!!
